(95 points) plus a stress-test boss encounter
(+10 bonus).

## What Happens

1. Runs the evaluator binary against your backend URL
2. Scores each trial and writes `results.json`
3. Uploads results as a GitHub artifact
4. Posts a score summary as a PR comment
   (on pull requests)
5. Updates the LEADERBOARD.md in your repo

## Local Testing

```bash
./evaluator \
  -url http://localhost:3000 \
  -team my-team \
  -secret default-secret-change-me \
  -output results.json
```

## Rebuilding

From the parent repository (aasanchez/42-challenge):

```bash
make evaluator-publish
```
